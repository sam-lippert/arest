# Induction

<!--
## Description
Vocabulary for the induce Func (#846-#852). The engine's search loop
populates Hypothesis Candidate facts; ranking is AUTOMATED and domain-
agnostic (forward-chain COVERAGE of the observed facts (the gate) plus
SIMPLICITY/MDL [fewest hidden facts; Occam/Solomonoff]) NOT hand-
declared per-app. Per Halpin, rulemaking is itself automatable, so the
ranking meta-rule is INDUCED (CSDP applied at the meta level), the
inductive complement of deduction, not a user knob. A Scoring Rule, when
present, is a derived/induced fact, never a hand-tuned per-domain heuristic.
Whitepaper §3 + Theorem 4: induce is a ρ-application over P that returns
candidate populations as facts in P.

## Entity Types
Hypothesis Candidate(.id) is an entity type.
Scoring Rule(.id) is an entity type.

## Value Types
Confidence Score is a value type.

## Fact Types
### Hypothesis Candidate
Hypothesis Candidate has Confidence Score.
  Each Hypothesis Candidate has at most one Confidence Score.

Hypothesis Candidate explains Fact.

### Scoring Rule
Scoring Rule applies to Hypothesis Candidate.

## Instance Facts
