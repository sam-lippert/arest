  Each Domain Change targets exactly one Domain.

Domain Change is valid. *

### Signal

Signal leads to Domain Change.
  Each Signal leads to at most one Domain Change.

Signal has Signal Source.
  Each Signal has exactly one Signal Source.

### Domain Change actions

User submits Domain Change for review.

## Subtypes

Model Element is a supertype of Reading.
Model Element is a supertype of Noun.
Model Element is a supertype of Constraint.
Model Element is a supertype of Fact Type.
Model Element is a supertype of Status.
Model Element is a supertype of Transition.

## Constraints

Each Domain Change proposes some Model Element.
It is possible that the same Domain Change proposes more than one Model Element.

It is obligatory that each Domain Change has exactly one Rationale.

It is forbidden that a Domain Change targeting Domain 'core' is applied without Signal Source 'Human'.
It is forbidden that a Domain Change targeting Domain 'evolution' is applied without Signal Source 'Human'.
It is forbidden that a Domain Change targeting Domain 'ethics' is applied without Signal Source 'Human'.

## Derivation Rules

### Domain Change is valid is implemented by the compile pipeline:
### (1) all proposed Model Elements are parseable as FORML 2
### (2) the proposed population is consistent with the existing population in the target Domain
### (3) the proposed Constraints are satisfiable with the existing Constraints in the target Domain
