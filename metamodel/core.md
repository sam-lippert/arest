## Entity Types

Function(.id) is an entity type.
Noun is a subtype of Function.
  Event Type is a subtype of Resource.
  Fact Type is a subtype of Event Type.
  {Event Type, Status, Constraint, Derivation Rule} are mutually exclusive subtypes of Resource.
  <!-- elysium-audit A: State Machine Definition removed from the exclusive
       list. state.md declares `State Machine Definition is a subtype of
       Status` (the Harel nesting, deliberate per instances.md task-987),
       so SMD and Status cannot also be mutually exclusive siblings — the
       pair of declarations forced SMD's population empty. SMD inherits
       Status's exclusions through the subtype. -->


Reading(.id) is an entity type.

Role(.id) is an entity type.

<!-- `Format` was a value type here (legacy widget Format: 'text', 'date',
     'boolean'). It is PROMOTED to a first-class, extensible entity type
     `Format(.Name)` in the NORMA Value Domain section below (alongside
     `Conceptual Data Type`), so new presentation Formats are added by
     declaring instances rather than editing a closed enumeration. The
     `Noun has Format` binary at :109 is unchanged in surface syntax but is
     now an entity-valued refinement link (Noun -> Format entity). No live
     reading or app ever populated `Noun has Format`, so the promotion is
     data-safe. See "## NORMA Value Domain" -> Format. -->

  <!-- task-961 Phase A: a VALUE-typed presence projection of the absorbed
       `referenceScheme` field on the Noun cell. `Reference Scheme` is a
       value type, so this functional binary is RMAP-absorbed into the Noun
       cell (no own data cell) and `rmap::reconstitute_absorbed_ft` projects
       it back out as `<<Noun, X>, <Reference Scheme, "id,…">>` for exactly
       those Nouns whose `referenceScheme` key is present (an entity with a
       declared `(.col)` reference scheme). lower_camel("Reference Scheme")
       == "referenceScheme", so reconstitution locates the stored value.
       This is the materializable 2nd conjunct of `Noun is instantiable`
       below — it replaces the entity-valued `Noun has Reference Scheme
       Noun`, which never populated for real entities (their identity lives
       in the absorbed field, not an entity-valued fact). -->
Noun is subtype of Noun.
Noun is described to AI by prompt Text.
Noun has World Assumption.
  Each Noun has exactly one World Assumption.
Noun is independent.
Noun is of schema:Thing.
  Each Noun is of at most one schema:Thing.

Noun plays Role.
  It is obligatory that each Noun plays some Role.
  For each Role, exactly one Noun plays that Role.
  It is possible that some Noun plays more than one Role.
Noun is instantiable. **
  <!-- task-961 lift (shipped bdde710d/a9a78c74): a Noun is instantiable iff
       it is an entity type (objectType='entity') AND it has a reference
       scheme (identity). The derivation under ## Derivation Rules below
       carries the logic; the Rust create/update gate at
       command.rs::noun_runtime_defined reads this stored cell first.

       task-961 Phase A (derivation rework): the 2nd conjunct now reads the
       VALUE-typed presence projection `Noun has Reference Scheme` (above),
       which reconstitutes from the absorbed `referenceScheme` field — so the
       derivation MATERIALIZES the real entity types (Task, Source File, App,
       Domain, …). Previously the 2nd conjunct pointed at the entity-valued
       `Noun has Reference Scheme Noun`, which is never populated for real
       entities, so this cell stayed empty for them and the procedural
       fallback alone carried the gate. The `**` marker stores the consequent.

       task-961 Phase B: the alethic instantiability constraint below makes
       the rejection of a non-instantiable-noun create/update DECLARATIVE.
       `command.rs::noun_runtime_defined` treats the cell as the AUTHORITATIVE
       source whenever it is NON-EMPTY. A create of a noun absent from a
       populated `Noun_is_instantiable` is rejected (D' = D, per AREST.tex
       eq:create §157). The procedural Noun-cell scan was retained as a
       fallback ONLY for states where the cell was still empty.

       task-961 Phase C (this codebase): `compile_to_defs_state` now ALWAYS
       emits `_Noun_is_instantiable_compiled` (same predicate: objectType='entity'
       AND non-empty referenceScheme, evaluated at compile time against the Noun
       cell). `noun_instantiable_per_cell` checks BOTH `Noun_is_instantiable`
       (forward-chain-produced) AND `_Noun_is_instantiable_compiled` (compile-time
       constant, with FFP `[', Seq]` wrapper unwrapped), providing a fast-path
       declarative admit for any noun known at compile time.  The procedural
       fallback `noun_runtime_defined_procedural` is RETAINED for:
         (a) states built without `compile_to_defs_state` (phi-state test
             fixtures like `apply_command_phi_state()`), and
         (b) nouns added to `state` dynamically after the last compile.
       Full procedural removal requires guaranteeing every `apply` path passes
       through `compile_to_defs_state` — a follow-up child task.

       `compile_noun_is_instantiable_compile_time_cell_matches_procedural_predicate`

       the compile-time `_Noun_is_instantiable_compiled` cell is a structural
       impossibility and rejects (D' = D). The check is a set-membership test

       impl⟩ with origin ∈ {compiled, registered}; Eq 5 filters DEFS on
       origin = 'registered', Cor 5 identifies that restriction with the
       decidability frontier, and Cor 1 reads rule bodies as data. Without
       an origin fact the boundary is not a query over P — it lived only in
       host kernels (the 17 boundary atoms were undeclared in-canon; the
       rebuild's manifest DEF is the ready salvage). At-most-one rather
       than exactly-one: Function's population includes runtime Resources
       (instances.md) that carry no definition; origin is mandatory exactly
       for DEFS entries. Signature (dom/cod) facts follow when the canon
       manifest lands. -->

     a bound on the SIZE of a type's population (NORMA CardinalityConstraint),
     distinct from frequency's per-value occurrence bound. It was absent from
     this metamodel. Cor 2 leans on the kind directly: "a rate limit is a

     from its bound. -->

<!-- elysium-audit B: the former rings here (irreflexive + intransitive; and
     validation.md carried irreflexive + asymmetric) contradicted Lem 1 and
     each other. Lem 1 licenses arbitrary recursion — self- and mutual
     recursion included (transitive closure is a legitimate rule) — and
     forbids exactly one shape: a VALUE-INTRODUCING rule on a dependency
     cycle. Intransitivity even forbade legitimate dependency diamonds
     (DR1→DR2→DR3 with DR1→DR3). Cor 1 makes the true check a query over
     the dependency graph; the faithful constraint follows. -->

Derivation Rule introduces values. +
  <!-- Cor 1: value introduction is syntactic — a rule body applies a
       definition with origin 'registered' (the Eq 5 boundary) or a
       value-constructing base operation (arithmetic, length, dynamic
       application); every other operation rearranges atoms already in
       adom(P) or quoted in the rule. Semi-derived: the compiler asserts it
       from the body's clause shapes; an author may also assert it. -->

Derivation Rule reaches Derivation Rule. *

It is impossible that some Derivation Rule introduces values and that Derivation Rule reaches that Derivation Rule.
  <!-- Lem 1's hypothesis as an alethic constraint, refused like any other

<!-- elysium-audit B: "some other Derivation Rule" dropped from this rule —
     it filtered self-loops out of the dependency graph, so a
     value-introducing self-recursive rule (a 1-cycle Lem 1 must refuse)
     was invisible to the Cor 1 check. Self-dependency is a legitimate,
     recordable edge. -->

* Derivation Rule1 reaches Derivation Rule2 iff Derivation Rule1 depends on Derivation Rule2.

## Implicit Derivation Rules (#316 / #287c)

<!--
The four derivations below are currently materialised by the
compiler's `compile_derivations` synthesis pass (per-subtype, per-SS,
per-noun-FT, per-binary-pair fan-out). Expressing them as rules in the
metamodel closes the loop: the parser will drive them straight from
these readings once #317 lands anaphora + subscript + metamodel-cell
push; until then the Rust synthesis continues to cover them.
-->

### Subtype inheritance

Every fact that binds a subtype also binds the supertype: if `Noun1`
is a subtype of `Noun2` and a Fact uses a Resource whose Noun is
`Noun1` for some Role, then that same Resource is also an instance of
`Noun2`. In ORM this IS `Resource is instance of Noun` — subtyping is
population inclusion (Halpin, "Subtyping Revisited": all instances of a
type are instances of its supertype), so instance-of is transitive and
the runtime mirror is deliberately over-broad to carry it. Inheritance
proper is PROPERTY reuse (a subtype plays the supertype's roles because
it IS a supertype instance), not a distinct membership relation.

<!-- RETIRED 2026-07-09 (challenged + NORMA-verified): `Resource is
     inherited instance of Noun` was a non-canonical relation — ORM has
     no separate "inherited membership", and it only existed to prop up
     the (also non-canonical, now relaxed) `instance of exactly one
     Noun`. It had ZERO readers in base or apps (grep: only its own
     declaration), so retiring it removes dead derived data.
* Resource is inherited instance of Noun iff Resource is instance of some subtype of that Noun. -->


### Subset Constraint auto-fill (SS)

<!--
Each declared Subset Constraint whose `autofill` span marker is true
copies every antecedent fact into the consequent Fact Type. One
DerivationRule per SS constraint, each routed through
`compile_explicit_derivation` as a single-antecedent rule.
-->

* Fact is in consequent Fact Type iff some Subset Constraint has autofill 'true' and Subset Constraint spans antecedent Fact Type and Fact is instance of that antecedent Fact Type.

### Transitivity of binary Fact Types

<!--
For each pair of binary Fact Types `(A R B, B R C)` where the second
Role of the first FT and the first Role of the second FT share a Noun,
emit inferred `A R C` facts. Compile-time enumerates FT pairs; runtime
derives one fact per join.
-->

* Fact Type has inferred Fact iff some Fact uses Resource for the first Role of that Fact Type and some other Fact uses other Resource for the second Role of a Fact Type sharing the join Noun.

## Check-Readings Deontic Obligations (#288)

<!--
Layers 2 and 3 of the readings checker (`crates/arest/src/check.rs`)
enforce ring-constraint validity and completeness as Rust control
flow today. Expressing them as deontic constraints here lets #317's
metamodel-FT push eventually drive them through Theorem 4's
violation path — the Rust layers retire, and authors see the same
diagnostics via the standard violation surface.
-->

### Layer 2: ring validity — same-noun spans

A ring constraint (`IR`, `AS`, `AT`, `SY`, `IT`, `TR`, `AC`, `RF`)
must span roles whose Nouns are identical. A ring across mixed
nouns is nonsensical — `No Customer is-subtype-of Address` has
nothing to forbid. check.rs emits an Error-level diagnostic
today; the deontic form is the same invariant spelled
declaratively.

It is obligatory that each Ring Constraint spans two Roles and both Roles are played by the same Noun.

### Layer 3: ring completeness — declare the ring on a same-noun binary

A binary Fact Type whose two Roles share the same Noun almost
always wants an explicit ring constraint — without one, nothing
prevents the self-reference cycle the schema is implicitly
modelling. check.rs emits a Hint-level diagnostic that points
authors at the missing `is acyclic.` / `is irreflexive.`
annotation.

It is obligatory that each binary Fact Type whose Roles are played by the same Noun has some Ring Constraint spanning it.

## NORMA Structural Decomposition (#279)

<!--
The concepts below mirror NORMA's `ORMCoreMetaModel.orm`
decomposition of derivation rule bodies. They are the FORML 2
surface that the meta-circular parser (#280) populates by
decomposing each user-authored rule into a `Join Path` +
`Role Sequence` + `Role Projection`, rather than classifying the
rule text with Rust heuristics.
-->

Paper §4 Table 1 correspondence:
  Join Path       ↔ Composition (COMP)
  Role Sequence   ↔ Construction (CONS)
  Role Projection ↔ Selector
  Join Type       ↔ Condition (COND)

### Entity types

Join Path(.id) is an entity type.
Join(.id) is an entity type.
Role Sequence(.id) is an entity type.
Role Projection(.id) is an entity type.
Join Type(.Name) is an entity type.

### Value types

Clusivity is a value type.
  The possible values of Clusivity are 'inclusive', 'exclusive'.

Derivation Storage Type is a value type.

Fact Type has Derivation Storage Type.
  Each Fact Type has at most one Derivation Storage Type.

## Antecedent Clause Shape (#281)

<!--
Every clause inside a derivation-rule antecedent should parse into a
recognised `Clause Shape`. If the compiler can't attach a shape (the
clause didn't match any known pattern — Fact-Type literal, Antecedent
Role bind, Negation, Comparison, …) the rule is unsafe to chain and
the validator surfaces the violation. Expressing this as a deontic
constraint lets the runtime emit the diagnostic through Theorem 4's
violation path rather than a hard-coded check pass.
-->

Antecedent Clause(.id) is an entity type.
Clause Shape is a value type.
  The possible values of Clause Shape are 'fact-type-literal', 'antecedent-role', 'negation', 'comparison', 'conjunction', 'quantified', 'unresolved'.

Derivation Rule has Antecedent Clause.
  Each Derivation Rule has some Antecedent Clause.
  For each Antecedent Clause, exactly one Derivation Rule has that Antecedent Clause.

Antecedent Clause has Clause Shape.
  Each Antecedent Clause has at most one Clause Shape.

It is obligatory that each Antecedent Clause has Clause Shape.

It is forbidden that each Noun has a name that ends with 'ies'.

## Migration (#348)

### Rationale
Population-level rewriting when a schema evolves. §5 allows migration
to land as derivation rules / transition triggers / deontic
constraints; none is shaped for "rewrite facts of one Fact Type into
facts of another," so `Migration` names it directly. Firing a rule
emits a `MigrationApplication` (#349); visible_population (#350)
projects out migrated sources, keeping P monotonic.

Migration(.id) is an entity type.
Migration Rule Text is a value type.

Migration has source Fact Type.
  Each Migration has exactly one source Fact Type.

Migration produces target Fact Type.
  Each Migration produces some target Fact Type.

Migration has Migration Rule Text.
  Each Migration has exactly one Migration Rule Text.

Migration has Timestamp.
  Each Migration has exactly one Timestamp.

It is obligatory that each Migration produces some target Fact Type.

## Migration Application (#349)

### Rationale
Migration firing emits a Migration Application per source fact touched,
recording which target facts were produced and when. §5 Theorem 5 holds
because Migration Application is itself a fact: the visible_population
projection (#350) reads it to filter out migrated sources without a
destructive write, so population monotonicity is preserved and Cor 3
(closure under self-modification) survives.

Migration Application(.id) is an entity type.

Migration Application has Migration.
  Each Migration Application has exactly one Migration.

Migration Application has source Fact.
  Each Migration Application has exactly one source Fact.

Migration Application produces Fact.
  Each Migration Application produces some Fact.
  It is possible that some Migration Application produces more than one Fact.

Migration Application has Timestamp.
  Each Migration Application has exactly one Timestamp.

## Migration Application ordering (#351)

<!--
### Rationale
Two deontics compose migration chains and make federation convergence
constructive. The at-most-one obligation rules out direct v1 → v3
shortcuts: competing MAs for the same source row would flag, forcing
the chain through v2 via a paired Migration + MA. The distinct-Timestamp
obligation is what lets two peers replay the same Migration + MA stream
and converge by Cor 5 — timestamps establish the total order the
replay needs, and visible_population is a function of the replayed
set, so partial replays up to any T agree across peers.
-->

It is obligatory that each source Fact has at most one Migration Application per target Fact Type.

It is obligatory that each Migration Application has a distinct Timestamp.

       skeleton — JSON Type, the base JSON Format, and the Abstract SQL

       Format and an optional validation Pattern) without re-deriving the

  <!-- Optional regex `pattern` keyword for the Format (reuses the core
       `Pattern` value type at :67). Surfaces in the derived JSON Schema
       as `pattern`; absent when the Format imposes no lexical shape. -->

### Conceptual Data Types (#279)

NORMA's portable data-type catalog. Each leaf Conceptual Data Type is
classified into exactly one of eight Data Type Groups (text, numeric,
temporal, logical, raw, other, unspecified, userDefined). The `is in`
facts below are the single source of truth for both the leaf codes and
the group membership; the Data Type Group entities are populated by the
group codes those facts reference (no separate Name is carried in P1).
A value type opts into a data type with `The data type of <ValueType>
is <code>.`, which absorbs `conceptualDataType` onto the Noun cell.

The declaration may carry NORMA facets in a trailing clause (#279 P4):
`The data type of Price is decimal with precision 10 and scale 2.` and
`The data type of Code is text with length 50.`. These absorb onto the
Noun cell as `precision` / `scale` (via `Noun has Precision` / `Noun has
Scale` above) and `maxLength` (via the existing `Noun has Max Length`,
which text `length` reuses). Facets parameterize the projected DDL:
`DECIMAL(precision, scale)`, `CHARACTER VARYING(length)`, etc. The
`Facet` entity (with its own `Length` / `Digit Count` / `Binary
Precision`) models per-instance facet rows for a future supertype /
units pass and is independent of these absorbed Noun fields.

JSON-Schema projection of the catalog (#279 P2a). Each leaf carries one
JSON Type (the `type` keyword the OpenAPI / JSON-Schema generator emits
for a value-type property) and, for temporal / binary / uuid leaves, a
JSON Format. These absorb `jsonType` / `jsonFormat` onto the Conceptual
Data Type cell via RMAP, the same way `conceptualDataType` absorbs onto
Noun. The generator's `JsonTypeMappingTable` reads them back; its boot
fallback mirrors this block one-for-one.

<!--
SQL/DDL projection of the catalog (#279 P2b). NORMA maps a Conceptual
Data Type to SQL in two stages: first to an abstract SQL type (the
DCIL layer — a SQL-standard "predefined type" name), then to the
vendor type per dialect (`readings/templates/sql-dialects.md`). The
Abstract SQL Type facts below are stage one. They absorb `abstractSqlType`
onto the Conceptual Data Type cell via RMAP, the same way `jsonType`
absorbs (P2a) and `conceptualDataType` absorbs onto Noun (P1). The
generator's `AbstractSqlTypeTable` reads them back; its boot fallback
mirrors this block one-for-one.
-->

<!--
Type-mapping only (P2b): the IDENTITY / auto-increment semantics of
autoCounter / autoTimestamp and the unsigned-range CHECK constraints
of the unsigned* leaves are deferred to a later phase — here they map
to the abstract type that holds their VALUES (autoCounter / rowId /
objectId → INTEGER; the unsigned* leaves → the smallest signed
abstract type that fits, i.e. one width up where needed). uuid maps
to the abstract UUID type; dialects without a native UUID fall back to
CHARACTER in the vendor layer.

### Constraint Types (#747)

<!--
Each Constraint Type code below names one alethic constraint dispatch
arm in `compile.rs`. The Family groups codes that share an evaluation
shape (ring, set-comparison, subset/equality, value, frequency,
uniqueness, mandatory) so tooling — OpenAPI, docs, MCP introspection —
can enumerate the inventory from declared facts instead of reading the
Rust match. AT and ANS share the antisymmetric ring kernel; ANS is
preserved as a separate kind so the alias surfaces as a fact.
