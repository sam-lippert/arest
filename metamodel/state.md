### Status
Status is initial in State Machine Definition.
  Each State Machine Definition has at most one initial Status.
Status is defined in State Machine Definition. *
Status is terminal in State Machine Definition.
<!-- ASSERTED, not derived (CSDP). "Terminal" means "no outgoing Transition",
     which is a NEGATION; per CSDP discipline a derivation rule asserts only
     positive facts and closed-world negation is the validation layer's
     concern. So the modeler DECLARES each SM's sink Status(es) (exactly like
     `initial`). Completeness is validated by the existing `at least one
     terminal Status` obligation below; the consistency check (terminal => no
     outgoing Transition) belongs to the validation layer as a deontic
     constraint (follow-up — needs a join-safe phrasing). The behavioral
     "a sink affords nothing" already follows from the transition graph
     (has_outgoing), independent of this cell. -->
Status is rooted in State Machine Definition. *
Status is effective initial in State Machine Definition. *
<!-- sm-retire-forml2: the resolved seed status of a machine. The cardinality
     gate ("exactly one rooted ⇒ initial, else empty") is a non-monotonic
     predicate FORML 2 cannot express (count+`=1` does not compose as a same-rule
     filter; `no Status is initial` is not an antecedent kind — derivation.md
     193-223 / 414-422). So this `*` cell is populated by the RETAINED Rust
     effective-initial helper, which prefers an explicit `Status is initial in
     State Machine Definition` and else applies the cardinality gate over
     `Status is rooted in State Machine Definition`. The seed-branch rule for
     `State Machine is currently in Status` joins against this cell. This is the
     one deliberate, documented (state.md "Two things the rule is NOT able to
     express") non-monotonic remnant — retained, not newly added. -->

### Effective Transition (post-Harel available-transition relation)
<!-- sm-retire-forml2: the post-Harel <from, to, event> available-transition
     relation, multi-valued. REPLACES the Rust Harel expansion + transition_table
     + machine:{noun} + transitions:{noun} (compile.rs compile_state_machine
     11957-12003 fan-out). Rule 1 is the DIRECT declared edge; rule 2 is the
     INHERITED (Harel) edge: because State Machine Definition is a subtype of
     Status, a Transition whose single `from` Status IS the machine super-state
     induces an effective transition out of every child Status defined in that
     machine. Override-suppression (a child's own <event> edge shadowing the
     inherited one) is NOT expressible as a rule (negation is not an antecedent
     kind, and it would recurse through negation over this same FT) — the union
     deliberately over-emits and consumer-side firing precedence prefers the
     DIRECT row. The rules are under "## Derivation Rules". -->
Status has effective Transition to Status on Event Type. *

### Guard
Guard references Fact Type.
  It is possible that some Guard references more than one Fact Type and that for some Fact Type, more than one Guard references that Fact Type.
  For each combination of Guard and Fact Type, that Guard references that Fact Type at most once.
Guard guards Transition.
  Each Guard guards at most one Transition.
  It is possible that more than one Guard guards the same Transition.

## Derivation Rules

* Status is defined in State Machine Definition iff some Transition is defined in that State Machine Definition and that Transition is from that Status.

* Status is defined in State Machine Definition iff some Transition is defined in that State Machine Definition and that Transition is to that Status.

<!-- `Status is terminal` was derived by `… and no Transition is defined in
     that State Machine Definition where that Transition is from that Status`.
     The parser strips the leading `no` + trailing `where …` (AbsenceOf
     detection removed 2026-05-19, parse_forml2.rs) and falls back to the bare
     FT, so the rule compiled to `terminal == defined` — EVERY defined Status
     was flagged terminal (verified live: 32/32). Remodeled to an ASSERTED
     base fact per CSDP (declared per SM in the app readings, like `initial`);
     the negation now lives in the exclusion constraint below. No engine
     change: the parser limitation is sidestepped, not worked around. -->


<!--
  #759 / Audit MC3b-a: normalized SM derivation rules covering Pass 1
  / 2 / 2b of the Rust function `derive_state_machines_from_facts`
  (compile.rs:372-507). Together with the existing transition-driven
  derivation above, these rules let the SM cell be populated from
  instance facts via the engine's forward-chain — no Rust path needed.
  The existing JSON-blob StateMachine cell stays live as fallback
  until #761-#763 swap consumers over and #763 deletes the typed
  StateMachineDef + the Rust function.

    Pass 1 (compile.rs:376-383): instance facts of the form
      `State Machine Definition 'X' is for Noun 'Y'`
    already register the SM record by virtue of the FT itself; no
    derivation rule needed.

    Pass 2 (compile.rs:385-401): an `initial in` declaration entails
    that the same Status is defined in the same SM. The rule below
    fires whenever the parser captures the initial-marking fact,
    populating `Status_is_defined_in_State_Machine_Definition` so
    downstream consumers see initial Statuses without the Rust path.

    Pass 2b (compile.rs:403-415): a non-initial
      `Status 'S' is defined in State Machine Definition 'X'`
    instance fact is a direct assertion the parser already routes
    into the same cell; no derivation rule needed (Status is defined
    in SM is `*` in the FT declaration above for the transition-driven
    derivation, but assertable instance facts still land in the cell
    per the parser's normal instance-fact pathway).

* Status is defined in State Machine Definition iff that Status is initial in that State Machine Definition.

<!--
  #760 / Audit MC3b-b: Pass-4 graph-derived initial Status. Mirrors
  the source-never-target topology fold in
  `derive_state_machines_from_facts` at compile.rs:479-505.

  A Status is "rooted" in a SM iff it is the source of some Transition
  in that SM and no Transition in that SM has it as target. The
  consumer side (#761 — `compile_state_machine`) promotes a single
  rooted Status to `is initial in` ONLY when the rooted set has
  cardinality 1; ambiguity (multiple rooted, zero rooted, or cycles)
  leaves the SM without an inferred initial — the same behaviour the
  Rust path implements at compile.rs:502-504.

  Two things the rule is NOT able to express on its own and that the
  consumer side (#761) must therefore implement:

  (1) Uniqueness gate. FORML 2 derivations are monotonic — "exactly
      one rooted Status per SM" is a cardinality predicate, not a
      join. Per task #760's option (a) we deliberately stop short
      and emit every candidate; the consumer applies cardinality.

  (2) Strict set-difference negation. The parser currently strips
      the leading `no` and the trailing `where …` clause and falls
      back to resolving the bare FT (parse_forml2.rs:1184-1194), so
      the negative antecedent does not produce an `AbsenceOf` source
      — only the explicit `_cwa_negation_…` synthetic rules in
      compile.rs:2546-2599 currently emit AbsenceOf, and only for
      CWA nouns. Until parser-side negation lands as a follow-up,
      this rule over-emits for source-AND-target Statuses; the
      consumer's cardinality gate filters that case naturally
      (over-emit ⇒ |rooted| > 1 ⇒ no initial inferred ⇒ same end
      result as the Rust path's "ambiguous" branch).

  See task #760 report for grammar coverage notes.

* Status is rooted in State Machine Definition iff some Transition is defined in that State Machine Definition and that Transition is from that Status and no Transition is defined in that State Machine Definition where that Transition is to that Status.

<!-- sm-retire-forml2: post-Harel effective-transition relation. Rule 1 is the
     DIRECT declared edge (the literal Transition from its single `from` Status).
     Rule 2 is the INHERITED / Harel edge: State Machine Definition is a subtype
     of Status, so a Transition whose single `from` Status IS the machine
     super-state induces an effective transition out of every child Status that
     is defined in that machine. The two from-roles never collapse: rule 2's
     first antecedent types the from-value as a State Machine Definition entity,
     so it fires ONLY when the from-Status is itself a machine; the child clause
     then ranges over that machine's members via the already-derived
     `Status is defined in State Machine Definition` cell. Noun-scoping is
     intrinsic (the join is through the SMD), preserving #813 — shared status
     names never cross-attach. The union over-emits a child's overridden edge
     (direct + inherited); firing precedence (consumer-side) picks the direct
     row, the affordance path tolerates the extra legal row. -->

* Status1 has effective Transition1 to Status2 on Event Type iff Transition1 is from Status1 and Transition1 is to Status2 and Transition1 is triggered by Event Type.

<!-- sm-retire-forml2 RULE 2 (Harel inherited edge), now ENABLED. State Machine
     Definition is a subtype of Status, so a Transition whose single `from`
     Status IS the machine super-state induces an effective transition out of
     every child Status defined in that machine. This was previously blocked:
     compute_ring_join_plan (parse_forml2.rs) dropped the `State Machine
     Definition1` token (a Status subtype) from the `Transition is from Status`
     arity count, so the ring plan bailed and the rule derived 0 inherited rows.
     The planner now accepts a subtype filler in a supertype-typed role (the
     supertype_chain walk), mirroring the existing subtype bridge in
     resolve_derivation_rule, so the rule fires. Noun-scoping is intrinsic (the
     join threads through the SMD), preserving #813 — shared status names never
     cross-attach. The union over-emits a child's overridden edge (direct +
     inherited); consumer-side firing precedence picks the direct row. -->
* Status1 has effective Transition1 to Status2 on Event Type iff Transition1 is from State Machine Definition1 and Transition1 is to Status2 and Transition1 is triggered by Event Type and Status1 is defined in State Machine Definition1.

<!-- elysium-audit C: transitive reachability over declared transitions,
     feeding the Liveness obligation under ## Constraints. -->

* Status1 reaches Status2 in State Machine Definition iff some Transition is defined in that State Machine Definition and that Transition is from Status1 and that Transition is to Status2.

* Status1 reaches Status3 in State Machine Definition iff Status1 reaches Status2 in that State Machine Definition and Status2 reaches Status3 in that State Machine Definition.



## Constraints

For each Noun, at most one State Machine Definition is for that Noun.
Each State Machine Definition has exactly one initial Status.
It is obligatory that each State Machine Definition has at least one terminal Status.
If some Status is initial in some State Machine Definition then that Status is defined in that State Machine Definition.

### Liveness (AREST.tex, after Thm 2)

Status reaches Status in State Machine Definition. *

It is obligatory that if some Status reaches that Status in some State Machine Definition then that Status reaches some Status that is terminal in that State Machine Definition.
<!-- elysium-audit C: the paper's liveness discipline is "the deontic
     obligation that each cycle carry some exit transition." Quantifying
     over cycles is outside fragment R, so this transcribes the expressible
     strengthening: a Status on a cycle (one that reaches itself) must
     reach some terminal Status. Reaching a terminal forces an edge out of
     the cycle's strongly-connected component, so this implies the paper's
     obligation (not conversely: an exit into another trap cycle satisfies
     the paper's sentence but not this one). Deontic: a trapped cycle warns
     and commits. Until now the docs QUOTED the cycle-exit obligation as if
     declared, while only the weaker at-least-one-terminal obligation above
     existed as a reading. The `reaches` rules (under Derivation Rules) use
     declared Transition edges — conservative w.r.t. Harel-inherited edges,
     which only add reachability; an effective-transition base rule can be
     added if over-warning bites. -->

## Instance Facts

Domain 'state' has Access 'public'.

<!-- task-965 lift (shipped 6393ceb3): the HATEOAS destructive-affordance
     rule, lifted from a Rust literal (command.rs http_method_for_status)
     into a reading. A transition whose target Status has a declared HTTP
     Method surfaces with that method; all others default to GET. -->
Status 'deleted' has HTTP Method 'DELETE'.
