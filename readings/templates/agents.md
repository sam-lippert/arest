# AREST Agents: AI Behavioral Entities

## Entity Types

Model(.code) is an entity type.
Agent Definition(.id) is an entity type.
Agent(.id) is an entity type.
Completion(.id) is an entity type.

## Value Types

# Declared nowhere until 2026-09-07: `Agent Definition has Prompt` built over
# an undeclared Prompt, so no instance of it could ever land and every Agent
# Definition violated `has exactly one Prompt` from the moment it existed.
Prompt is a value type.
  The data type of Prompt is largeText.

## Readings

### Model
Model has Name.
  Each Model has exactly one Name.

### Agent Definition
Agent Definition belongs to Domain.
  Each Agent Definition belongs to exactly one Domain.

Agent Definition has Name.
  Each Agent Definition has exactly one Name.

Agent Definition uses Model.
  Each Agent Definition uses exactly one Model.

Agent Definition has Prompt.
  Each Agent Definition has exactly one Prompt.

### Agent
Agent is instance of Agent Definition.
  Each Agent is instance of exactly one Agent Definition.

Agent is for Object Type Instance.
  Each Agent is for at most one Object Type Instance.

### Completion
Completion belongs to Agent.
  Each Completion belongs to exactly one Agent.

Completion has input Text.
  Each Completion has exactly one input Text.

Completion has output Text.
  Each Completion has at most one output Text.

Completion occurred at Timestamp.
  Each Completion occurred at exactly one Timestamp.

### Predicate connection
Predicate invokes Agent Definition.
  Each Predicate invokes at most one Agent Definition.

<!--
  Engine wiring: when a Predicate invokes an Agent Definition, the verb
  name resolves to `Func::Platform(name)` in DEFS. The handler
  (installed per-target via `arest::externals` / `install_platform_fn`
  or `install_async_platform_fn`) walks the Agent Definition's `uses
  Model` + `has Prompt` facts to assemble the request, calls the
  model, and writes the resulting `Completion` cell. No separate
  agent-dispatch machinery — the same `Func::Platform` path serves
  every external function (LLMs, HTTP APIs, hardware sensors).

  Targets that don't install a handler (e.g. the bare kernel) see
  `Object::Bottom` for the call — graceful skip, not a panic.
