# AREST UI: iFactr.Android / MonoCross + Material Design Layout Grammar

This reading transcribes the canonical iFactr.Android / MonoCross navigation
model and Android Material Design (v1/Holo-to-Material) layout values as FORML
2 fact types and instance facts. It is additive over `readings/ui/ui.md` (the
platform-agnostic view hierarchy), `readings/ui/monoview.md` (the per-app
render surface), and `readings/ui/design.md` (the modern-minimal token layer).

The kernel UI currently hard-codes scattered card geometry. This reading gives
the layout grammar "facts all the way down": the per-component dp values, the
Material type scale (Roboto), the elevation/shadow ladder, the touch-target and
spacing grid, and the iFactr view-type to Android-widget mappings are all
instance facts a renderer can read. No magic numbers in Rust/Slint; the
renderer queries these cells.

## Instance Facts

<!-- This file's part of the domain: iFactr.Android + Material Design layout grammar — view-type to widget mappings, Roboto type scale, spacing grid, elevation ladder, touch targets, list-item heights, and pane weights as instance facts so no renderer hard-codes geometry.
     The sentence below is readings/ui/ui.md:403 repeated verbatim.
     core.md:220 makes Description functional, so a domain carries ONE
     text and an identical sentence is the identical fact. -->
Domain 'ui' has Description 'Platform-agnostic view hierarchy, navigation, and controls. Custom renderers registered per platform via the factory pattern.'.
