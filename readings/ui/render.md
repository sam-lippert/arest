# AREST UI: Render — Display, Surface, Frame

This reading reifies the rendering substrate as FORML 2 fact types and
instances. Today the kernel renders into a firmware-mapped framebuffer
(UEFI `GraphicsOutputProtocol`) or a virtio-gpu DMA-backed surface via
plain Rust types in `crates/arest-kernel/src/framebuffer.rs`. After
this reading lands, the rendering substrate is a graph of cells the
same way every other AREST concept is — a Display, Surfaces drawn into
that Display, and Frames presented onto those Surfaces. The kernel's
existing triple-buffer driver becomes one population of these facts,
and future targets (a phone with HDMI + DSI, a workstation with three
monitors, a headless build agent with a virtual surface) populate the
same entity types without inventing new ground-truth.

This reading is additive over `readings/ui/ui.md` (the platform-
agnostic view hierarchy), `readings/ui/monoview.md` (the per-app
render surface), and `readings/ui/components.md` (the toolkit-side
widget registry). The composition direction is the obvious
containment chain: a Frame belongs to a Surface, a Surface belongs to
a Display, and the MonoView regions defined in #457 project content
into Surfaces without restating any of the geometry here. The
component selection rules in #485 already score against MonoView
constraints; once a binding is selected, its rendered output lands in
some Surface as a sequence of Frames.

## Entity Types

Display(.Name) is an entity type.
  <!-- The physical or virtual output the kernel drives. The .Name
       reference mode is a stable slug — 'gop' for the firmware-
       mapped UEFI surface, 'virtio-gpu-0' for the virtio-gpu scanout
       wired by `install_virtio_gpu`, 'hdmi-0' / 'dsi-0' for future
       multi-output hardware. One Display per kernel boot today (the
       single GOP surface); the model admits many. -->

Surface(.Name) is an entity type.
  <!-- A logical drawable region within a Display. Slint windows, the
       Doom canvas, MonoView panes, and the boot paint smoke are all
       Surfaces. The .Name reference mode is a stable slug; the
       Origin / Width / Height fact types pin the rectangle in the
       parent Display's coordinate space. -->

Frame(.Name) is an entity type.
  <!-- A snapshot in time of a Surface's pixel content. The .Name
       reference mode is a per-Surface monotonic slug (typically the
       Surface slug suffixed with the Frame Index). One Frame per
       presented buffer; the kernel's triple-buffer driver advances
       Frame Index every time `framebuffer::present()` finds a non-
       empty dirty rect. -->

Pixel Format is an entity type.
  <!-- Closed catalog of the pixel layouts the kernel actually
       populates from `GraphicsOutputProtocol`'s `PixelFormat`
       enumeration (UEFI section 12.9). The reference scheme is the
       canonical slug of the variant. The Rust-side `PixelFormat`
       enum in framebuffer.rs is the ground truth; this entity type
       reifies the variant set so derivation rules can join through
       it without a free-form string. -->

## Value Types

Display Slug is a value type.
  <!-- Free-form identifier for a Display instance, e.g. 'gop',
       'virtio-gpu-0'. Opaque to the readings checker. -->

Surface Slug is a value type.
  <!-- Free-form identifier for a Surface instance, e.g.
       'kernel.boot-paint', 'doom.canvas', 'slint.hateoas'. -->

Frame Slug is a value type.
  <!-- Free-form identifier for a Frame instance, typically derived
       as '<surface>.<frame-index>' but the readings layer treats it
       as opaque. -->

Pixel Format Slug is a value type.
  The possible values of Pixel Format Slug are
    'rgb', 'bgr', 'u8', 'unknown'.
  <!-- One slug per `PixelFormat` variant in framebuffer.rs. 'rgb'
       and 'bgr' are the two byte-orderings GOP and virtio-gpu
       actually report; 'u8' is the greyscale fallback the draw
       helpers honour; 'unknown' covers GOP's `Bitmask` and `BltOnly`
       variants — surfaces flagged 'unknown' silently no-op writes
       rather than corrupting the display. -->

Pixel Width is a value type.
  <!-- Horizontal extent in pixels. Non-negative integer. -->

Pixel Height is a value type.
  <!-- Vertical extent in pixels. Non-negative integer. -->

Pixel Origin is a value type.
  <!-- A coordinate component (X or Y) in the parent Display's pixel
       space. Non-negative integer; the origin is the top-left of the
       Surface rectangle. -->

Refresh Rate is a value type.
  <!-- Nominal vertical refresh in Hz. Free-form integer; absent on
       Displays whose firmware does not report a refresh rate (the
       firmware-mapped GOP surface typically does not). -->

Display Backend is a value type.
  The possible values of Display Backend are
    'gop', 'virtio-gpu', 'headless'.
  <!-- The transport that carries Frame bytes to the Display.
       'gop' = firmware-mapped MMIO surface (UEFI
       `GraphicsOutputProtocol`); the GPU reads it on its own vsync.
       'virtio-gpu' = DMA-backed 2D resource attached to a scanout;
       `present()` issues a `RESOURCE_FLUSH` so the host blits to the
       display (virtio-gpu spec section 5.7.6.7).
       'headless' = no firmware surface; rendering goes through the
       hash-only smoke path (`front_fnv1a` checksum without an
       attached display). -->

Frame Index is a value type.
  <!-- Monotonic non-negative integer. Increments every time
       `framebuffer::present()` finds a non-empty dirty rect on the
       owning Surface. The kernel's `presents` counter is the
       runtime peer. -->

Wall Time is a value type.
  <!-- Free-form ISO-8601 timestamp string. Opaque to the readings
       checker. Optional on every Frame; populated when the kernel
       has a wall clock and chooses to record it (smoke-test traces
       always do, hot rendering paths usually do not). -->

Frame Bytes is a value type.
  <!-- Opaque byte payload carrying the Frame's pixel content. The
       readings layer does not interpret the bytes; consumers read
       the parent Surface's Pixel Format to decode. The kernel-side
       BackBuffer's byte slice is the runtime peer. -->

Frame Hash is a value type.
  <!-- FNV-1a checksum of a Frame's bytes. Used by the boot paint
       smoke (`front_fnv1a` / `back_fnv1a`) and by the eventual
       diff-presentation path to detect "did anything change since
       the last Frame on this Surface". Opaque hex-string at the
       readings layer. -->

## Derivation Rules

### Surface inherits Pixel Format

+ Surface has Pixel Format
    if Surface belongs to Display
    and Display has Pixel Format.
  <!-- A Surface's pixel layout follows its Display's by default.
       Surfaces that re-encode (e.g. a virtual headless surface
       capturing 'rgb' regardless of the parent's 'bgr') override
       the inherited Pixel Format with an explicit fact at the
       instance layer; FORML 2 derivation rules contribute facts
       additively, so the explicit value wins via the cardinality
       constraint elsewhere. -->

### Frame inherits Surface dimensions

+ Frame has Pixel Width
    if Frame belongs to Surface
    and Surface has Pixel Width.

+ Frame has Pixel Height
    if Frame belongs to Surface
    and Surface has Pixel Height.

## Instance Facts

The kernel framebuffer driver, virtio-gpu scanout, and future multi-output targets all populate the same entity types; the MonoView regions defined in #457 project content into Surfaces without restating any geometry here.
     The sentence below is readings/ui/ui.md:403 repeated verbatim.
     core.md:220 makes Description functional, so a domain carries ONE
     text and an identical sentence is the identical fact. -->
