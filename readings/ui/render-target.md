# AREST UI: Render Target — render functions in DEFS (whitepaper §5.2)

This reading reifies the §5.2 Platform Binding render seam as facts. A
Render Target is one registered render function: a `Func::Platform`
entry in DEFS (the `externals.rs` pattern — `register_runtime_fn` binds
the name, `install_platform_fn` attaches the callable at boot) that
turns the ViewProjection emitted by `view_via_rho`
(`readings/ui/view-projection.md`) plus an entity population into a
target-native widget tree. This reading declares WHICH targets exist
and which DEFS name each answers to, so render dispatch is a fact walk
— ρ over the Render Target population — not a hard-coded match in Rust.
A new target platform is one new Render Target instance plus one
installed function; no per-app glue, and a renderer that must know
about a specific app has leaked the seam.

The composition direction follows `readings/ui/render.md`: a Render
Target produces the CONTENT that lands in some Surface as Frames; the
Display / Surface / Frame substrate carries the bytes and never learns
the widget vocabulary, and this reading never restates geometry. The
widget vocabulary a render function consumes is the closed `Component
Role` catalog from `readings/ui/components.md`, resolved per value
type by the Format-else-CDT layer in `readings/ui/view-projection.md`.

## Domain Metadata

<!-- This file's part of the domain: Render Target -- registered render functions in DEFS (whitepaper Section 5.2) that turn a ViewProjection plus a population into a target-native widget tree.
     The sentence below is readings/ui/ui.md:403 repeated verbatim.
     core.md:220 makes Description functional, so a domain carries ONE
     text and an identical sentence is the identical fact. -->
Domain 'ui' has Description 'Platform-agnostic view hierarchy, navigation, and controls. Custom renderers registered per platform via the factory pattern.'.

## Entity Types

Render Target(.Name) is an entity type.
  <!-- One registered render function. The .Name reference mode is a
       stable slug — 'html' for the engine's reference markup
       renderer, 'slint' for the in-kernel surface, 'ui-do' for the
       hosted TS worker. The slug names the TARGET PLATFORM, not the
       app being rendered: every app renders through every installed
       target. -->

## Value Types

Platform Function Name is a value type.
  <!-- The DEFS binding the runtime installs the callable under, e.g.
       'render:html'. The 'render:' prefix is the namespace convention
       for render functions; the engine applies the bound Func to
       [view facts, entity data, affordances] when the target's
       function has an installed body, and skips the target gracefully
       (Object::Bottom discipline) when no body is installed. -->

MimeType is a value type.
  <!-- Media type of the rendered output, e.g. 'text/html'. Same value
       type the filesystem reading declares for File; declared here
       too so the ui-readings scope stands alone. Absent on targets
       whose output is not byte-addressed (an in-process widget tree
       handed straight to a toolkit). -->

## Fact Types

### Render Target

Render Target has Platform Function Name.
  Each Render Target has exactly one Platform Function Name.

Render Target emits MimeType.
  Each Render Target emits at most one MimeType.

Render Target has display- Title.
  Each Render Target has at most one display- Title.

Render Target has Description.
  Each Render Target has at most one Description.

### App opt-in marker (view-tree-shaking discriminator)

App uses Render Surface.
  <!-- THE render-surface opt-in (view-tree-shaking, 2026-06). This noun
       + value type stay in the ALWAYS-loaded base (UI_SCHEMA_READINGS in
       lib.rs) so the marker is cheap to declare and cheap to detect; the
       HEAVY view machinery (view-projection / view-detail / view-list /
       view-menu / render / components / monoview / ifactr-android / design
       / ui / render-subscription PLUS the Render Target INSTANCES) is a
       per-app OVERLAY (UI_VIEW_READINGS) that loads ONLY when an app's raw
       readings carry the substring `uses Render Surface`. A UI-less agent
       (tasks / claude / arc-agi-3) declares nothing here and pays ZERO view
       synthesis cost: `view_via_rho` finds no `view:` defs and no-ops, and
       `render_via_targets` finds no Render Target population and returns
       empty. The Render Surface value names the render slug an app wants
       (e.g. 'html'); the engine renders through every INSTALLED target. -->

Render Surface is a value type.
  <!-- The render slug an app opts into — the same stable slug a Render
       Target carries ('html' for the reference markup renderer). Declared
       here in the base so the marker fact resolves without the overlay. -->

## Constraints

No two Render Targets share the same Platform Function Name.

## Deontic Constraints

It is obligatory that each Render Target has some Platform Function Name.

<!-- The Render Target INSTANCE declarations (the reference 'html' renderer)
     moved OUT of this always-loaded schema reading into the per-app overlay
     `render-target-instances.md` (UI_VIEW_READINGS in lib.rs). They land
     only for apps that declare `App '<slug>' uses Render Surface '<surface>'`,
     so a UI-less app never inherits the render-function registry. -->
