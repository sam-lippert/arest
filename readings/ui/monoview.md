# AREST UI: MonoView Surface

This reading defines the per-app render surface — what the user calls
the "MonoView" — as FORML 2 fact types and instances. Pre-#457 the
pane mode of each app (master-detail vs single-pane vs popover) was a
hard-coded property of each `.slint` file, and downstream consumers
(ui.do React surface, terminal renderer) had no way to introspect or
override it without round-tripping through Slint source. After #457,
the entire surface — pane mode, regions, transitions, density,
interaction mode, surface tier, accessibility profile — is a reading,
the same way design tokens already are (#432, `readings/ui/design.md`).

The benefits are the FORML 2 dividend: derivations (touch interaction
implies spacious density without anyone restating it), validation via
the readings checker (a region cannot belong to two MonoViews), and
the same MCP / HATEOAS introspection over UI surface that already
works over data. A user-installed app advertises its preferences as a
`PanePreference` fact; the kernel projects them through the
derivation graph and the renderer reads the resulting facts. There is
no UI code that branches on app identity.

This reading is additive over `readings/ui/ui.md` (the platform-
agnostic view hierarchy) and `readings/ui/design.md` (the token
layer). The Slint kernel surface and the ui.do React frontend are
the two consumers; both follow as separate tracks (#457b/c).
