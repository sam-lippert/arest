## Derivation Rules

# Bot-introduced display-* derivations removed 2026-05-19. The FT
# shapes themselves are fine — `List Item has display- Text` and the
# sibling display-sub-Text / Display Status fields match the
# IListItem-style abstraction MonoView (iFactr) and similar
# cross-platform abstractions natively expose. What was wrong was
# computing those values inside the schema's forward chain via
# CWA-stratified negation (`Object Type Instance has no Reference`). The native
# idiom for "prefer A, fall back to B" in abstract rendering is a
# declarative binding chain on the UI element itself, not an
# AbsenceOf-guarded derivation. Re-introduce the display-* FTs when
# the binding-chain model is designed intentionally — the deletion
# here is about removing the AbsenceOf, not the IListItem fields.

## Deontic Constraints

It is obligatory that each Entity List has some Page Size.
It is obligatory that each Entity List has some Sort Field.
It is obligatory that each Entity List has some Sort Direction.

## Instance Facts
