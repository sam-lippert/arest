# AREST UI: Design System (Modern Minimal)

This reading defines the modern-minimal design system as FORML 2 fact
types and instances. It is the single source of truth consumed by both
the Slint kernel UI surface and the ui.do React frontend, so a token
change here propagates uniformly to every rendering target.

The system is restrained on purpose: one neutral 5-shade scale, one
accent, four semantic colors, two type families (Inter sans, JetBrains
Mono mono), a strict 4px spacing grid, and only two motion durations
(150ms / 250ms). Icons come exclusively from the Lucide icon set so the
icon bake at #434 has a closed enumeration to compile against.
