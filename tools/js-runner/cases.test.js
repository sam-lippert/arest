// comment syntaxes do not intersect), double-quoted strings only, and no
// trailing comma before the file's closing paren.
//
// NOTHING ENFORCED IT after engine/tests went. The check that did --
// test_intersection_shape.py -- approached the property directly, of the bytes,
// and its docstring records why that matters: "a file that four of the five
// hosts accept passes everything, because the fifth host is never pointed at
// it. That is exactly what happened: the ROOT canon accumulated eight `//`
// comment lines -- legal Rust, C#, Java and JS, invalid Python -- while only
// the curated engine/shared/arest.canon was fed to CPython."
//
// It used Python's parser as the strictest reader. With python gone no host
// rejects a `//`, so the rule needs asserting rather than inheriting -- and it
// was already broken: this session's canon carried the forbidden trailing comma
// until the byte check went looking for it.
//
// These are BYTE rules, not a parser. Whether the file PARSES is already proven
// by bun exec'ing the composition; what a parse cannot tell you is whether it
// would still parse somewhere else.
