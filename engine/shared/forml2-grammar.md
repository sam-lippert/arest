# FORML 2 Grammar

Classification grammar + recognizer derivation rules for FORML 2.
The parser is not a program. It is this file.

Stage-1 (#285) tokenizes input into `Statement` cells with structured
fields; Stage-2 (#280) applies the derivation rules below to populate
downstream metamodel cells (`Object Type`, `Fact Type`, `Role`,
`Instance Fact`, `Derivation Rule`, `Constraint`).

This file uses only Stage-1 bootstrap productions: entity types, value
types, enum values, binary / unary fact types, derivation rules.

## Statement Translator Dispatch (#833)

Per AREST.tex §3 (eq:sys) — *the entity handles the dispatch, not the
system function.* New translators are registered into DEFS without
modifying any entity. The Rust pipeline consults this table to
discover which translators apply to a given Statement Classification.
The relation is many-to-many: e.g., Subtype Declaration is handled by
both `translate_nouns` and `translate_subtypes`, and
`translate_set_constraints` handles five constraint kinds.

The Entity Type and Fact Type for this dispatch are declared in the
top-level `## Entity Types` and `## Fact Types` sections so the
bootstrap grammar parser picks them up. The Instance Facts populating
the table follow.

## Derivation Rules — the recognizers

Statement has Classification 'Entity Type Declaration' iff Statement has Trailing Marker 'is an entity type'.

Statement has Classification 'Value Type Declaration' iff Statement has Trailing Marker 'is a value type'.

Statement has Classification 'Subtype Declaration' iff Statement has Predicate 'is a subtype of'.

Statement has Classification 'Partition Declaration' iff Statement has Predicate 'is partitioned into'.

Statement has Classification 'Abstract Declaration' iff Statement has Trailing Marker 'is abstract'.

<!-- task-951: two surface forms lower to the same Predicate token, so a single
     recognizer covers both. Stage-1's extract_enum_values accepts either:

       1. "The possible values of <Object Type> are 'v1', 'v2', ..."  (FORML2 spec)
       2. "<Object Type> enumerates 'v1', 'v2', ..."                  (shorthand alias)

     Form (2) is mechanical sugar — stage-1 strips the Object Type and the literal
     'enumerates' keyword, then routes the remaining 'v1', 'v2', ... list to
     the same Enum_Value tokenizer, and overrides Predicate to 'the possible
     values of' so this classifier fires identically. There is no separate
     classifier rule for the shorthand. -->
Statement has Classification 'Enum Values Declaration' iff Statement has Predicate 'the possible values of'.

<!-- #279 P1: `The data type of <ValueType> is <code>.` assigns a portable
     Conceptual Data Type to a value type. Stage-1 recognises the leading
     phrase and overrides Predicate to 'the data type of' (mirroring the enum
     declaration's Predicate override), so this single recognizer fires. -->
