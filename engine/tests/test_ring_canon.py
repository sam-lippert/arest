"""#18: the ring-constraint reading handler, canonized — the first constraint-family
translator and the first with a non-phi objs half. The _COOK boundary resolves the
reading, so groups arrive as ⟨decl_rows, cid, kind_tag, ft, builder_name⟩; the canon
twin appends the constraint row (apndr) and emits ⟨cid, (builder : ⟨1,2⟩)⟩ — the
constraint OBJECT is the canonical builder applied through DEFS, which is exactly what
host C.ring_* does. The obj is a lambda, so the twin certifies it EXTENSIONALLY:
both objs applied to the same sample population answer the same violations."""
