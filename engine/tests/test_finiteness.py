"""The static condition that discharges Lemma finiteness' hypothesis: recursion through
the rule dependency graph is admitted (heads are range-restricted by construction, so the
fixpoint is over a finite atom domain and terminates), but no dependency CYCLE may pass
through value invention — a rule whose definition applies a registered (boundary)
function can introduce individuals drawn from no stored population, unboundedly. Acyclic
invention stays admissible. Definitions are cells, so the check reads rule bodies from D
like everything else."""
