"""Constraint-clause resolution as a canonical object (the L1 arc's next
pocket after the reading scan). system:clause_ft — ⟨text, knowns, stop,
declared⟩ → the fact-type id a quantified constraint clause references:
the MINIMAL quantifier strip (some/that/each/no) resolves first and wins
when its id is DECLARED (the article lesson: 'is a manager' declares
Employee_is_a_manager, and stripping the article resolved the clause to a
cell that does not exist — a silently unenforced constraint); otherwise
the full strip (+ an/a) answers regardless. The Python _clause_ft
(compiler.py) is the behavioral spec and becomes a thin caller; the
constraint clauses of the metamodel corpus are the twin oracle."""
