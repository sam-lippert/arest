"""The DDL generator (the GraphDL day job): readings to relational CREATE TABLE,
Halpin's Rmap output as SQL (book 10.3 for the grouping, 11.12 for the DDL). An
entity's table carries its absorbed functional fact types as columns: the primary
key from the reference scheme, NOT NULL exactly where a mandatory constraint
holds (Halpin: optional roles map to nullable columns), UNIQUE on absorbed
one-to-one columns, a BOOLEAN column per absorbed unary, and REFERENCES where the
column's player is an entity with its own table. An m:n fact type keeps its own
table with the spanning key as PRIMARY KEY and per-role references. The
fix-not-inherit rule rides along: the projection layer must never let one
incomplete entity cascade rows out of the view, so nullable FK columns REFERENCE
without NOT NULL."""
