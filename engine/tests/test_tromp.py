"""Tromp diagrams + the rho-fidelity checker (engine tasks 20 & 22).

The load-bearing-math litmus, exercised end to end:
  (a) the reified pure-lambda reducer takes I / K / S / TRUE to their expected normal forms;
  (b) a populated fact lifts to  lambda f. f(o1..on) , renders a sane Tromp diagram, reduces to
      that normal form, and projects each object by application (membership IS application);
  (c) the CHECKER lifts ALL 353 canon DEFs and certifies each a CLOSED, WELL-FORMED pure term
      --- reporting honestly the ones that reach the registered host boundary.
