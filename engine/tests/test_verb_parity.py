"""Two more first-class verbs from the old engine's surface, table-backed:
validate (the app's constraint validation over the SETTLED store — eq. create
only ever judged candidates, but instance facts in readings ingest unvalidated
and deontic violations commit by design, so a compiled store can carry drift)
and verify (the migration report's derived-population parity check turned
in-place self-audit: re-evaluate each fully-derived head's rules over the
settled store and compare with the stored cell). Both are Registry methods
behind one-line entries in the verb table, so every binding gains them at
once — the MCP layer is untouched beyond the table."""
