"""THE COVERAGE GATE (Samuel, 2026-07-08: "Is there a test that makes
sure that all functionality is available in the shared canon?"): every
name a host kernel dispatches is one of exactly three things —

  (1) the FP BASE vocabulary: the substrate the canon is written in
      (Backus's algebra: selectors, sequence ops, logic, arithmetic);
  (2) a declared D5 BOUNDARY transducer: transduction only, no policy
      (the lex family, cellkey, escape_html, skolem, strip_prefix;
      stage1_fields by the 2026-07-07 ruling — "a canonical composition
      is not owed at the boundary, exactly as lex itself");
  (3) CANON-NAMED: a certified-equal override for speed whose DEF of
      record must exist in shared/*.canon, twinned by its own pin.

A host op that fits none of these fails here: functionality lands in
the shared lambda source first, or it does not land. The semantic half
of the discipline stays with the per-override twin pins (classify,
render, vb_fetch, entity_view, ...); this gate is the structural half —
nothing can even be NAMED host-side without a canon story."""

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE VERB LAYER (the 2026-07-13 census, canon-first rebuild phase 1).
# Every verb mcp_call_inner dispatches is one of exactly three things:
#
#   (1) CATALOG: a resolution.md operation. Its reference is the canon
#       pipeline the verb reduces; a host binding is an override row.
#   (2) SERVE: store addressing and inventory (the tenancy surface —
#       a cell in one store may contain another entire store). These
#       verbs move between stores and report on them; they carry no
#       domain meaning to twin.
#   (4) REGISTERED (Samuel, 2026-07-13): the enumerable boundary at the
#       verb layer. An operation whose impl is supplied by the host
#       runtime — an LLM shaping synthesize wording, an LLM-judge
#       validate pass, sqlite materializing sql — registers through
#       DEFS with origin=registered (paper Def. 10, Cor. 8) and is the
#       ONE valid case to delegate without a shared canon: partial,
#       external, enumerable by the boundary Filter, never widening
#       the formal core. sql's delegated-by-design ruling is an
#       instance of this class.
#   (3) DELEGATED: meaning that still rides the Python reference host.
#       This set is the standing drain queue, ordered by the rebuild
#       plan: explain drained 2026-07-13 (catalog row + native walk
#       corroborated by canon system:explain); induce drained
#       2026-07-13 (the canon carries every judgment in the pipeline —
#       role_domain, enum_product, cand_gate, cand_covers, cand_score,
#       induce_judge — with the python inline loop the certified
#       override and AREST_NO_OVERRIDE selecting the canon-reducing
#       reference); sql stays delegated BY DESIGN (2026-07-13 ruling):
#       its meaning is canon (theta-1 over the RMAP projection) but its
#       materialization is a sqlite artifact, and the host build is
#       zero-dep by the 2026-07-09 decision recorded in Cargo.toml, so
#       the delegate is sql's reference and any native leg is an
#       opt-in cargo feature; compile drained 2026-07-13 on the
#       strength of the ch. 06 pipeline canonization (the canon defs
#       the native compile twins at byte parity, apps_compile_parity
#       the standing pin); propose drained 2026-07-13 (its judgment,
#       the sorted fact-type delta, is system:propose_report over the
#       compile machinery's throwaway world); ask drained 2026-07-13
#       (the plan query's filter algebra is canon: system:ask_pos
#       resolves role positions with the missing-noun # sentinel,
#       system:ask_row_ok judges a row against every spec, and
#       system:ask_filter keeps rows through it; the inline str()
#       comparison stays the wire-accommodation override); the tutor
#       four reclassified SERVE 2026-07-13: each is a first-class verb
#       SCOPED to the _tutor sandbox app (apply, compile, propose,
#       whose meanings are already canon) or sandbox lifecycle
#       (reset, the apps_create class), and scoping is addressing,
#       never meaning. THE QUEUE IS EMPTY (Samuel's all-verbs-canon
#       directive, discharged 2026-07-13): every dispatched verb is
#       CATALOG (meaning in the canon), SERVE (addressing), or
#       REGISTERED (the enumerable boundary, by design). A verb could
#       only re-enter this set by shipping new meaning host-side,
#       which the gate makes a loud choice.
#
# A verb that fits none of these fails here, exactly as a DEF-layer op
# with no canon story fails above.
