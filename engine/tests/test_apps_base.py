"""The base preload: apps compile ATOP the vendored base readings (the old
engine folds CORE_READINGS ahead of every app's own — lib.rs metamodel_readings),
so an app's rules resolve base-declared types (Resource, Status, State Machine,
Timestamp) without redeclaring them. The base compiles once per engine
fingerprint through frozen ingestion; app statements fold on top with the known
context (names, subtypes, fact types) READ OFF the thawed store."""
