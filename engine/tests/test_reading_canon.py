"""The mixfix reading scan as a canonical object (the keystone's first leaf
over the lex boundary). system:reading_parse — ⟨text, knowns, stop⟩ →
⟨template, roles⟩: the paper's field-replacement model, scanning left to
right over lex records, replacing each known type occurrence (LONGEST match,
maximal munch — order-independent, no pre-sorted operand) with a {i}
placeholder; NORMA hyphen binding (#24 — leading 'adj- {N}' and trailing
'{N} -adj' keep the WORD in the template with the one-sided touching hyphen
consumed, '--' escapes to one literal hyphen, and a hyphen touching both
sides ('from-Status') is just a word: the retired touching bind); the atomic
Title-case-run guard (a match whose continuation token is Title-case with no
known name covering the extended span is predicate text). system:ftid —
⟨template, roles⟩ → the stable fact-type id (roles substituted back, slugged).
The Python _reading/_ftid_from are the behavioral spec and become thin
callers; the whole metamodel corpus is the twin oracle."""
