"""The fact-type declaration translator as a canonical object — the L1
translator arc's LAST family. system:ft_rows — ⟨template, roles, kind⟩ →
the M-rows a declaration asserts (the sm_rows shape): the factType row
⟨ft, template⟩, one role row ⟨ft.i, ft, i, player⟩ per role in order, and
the derivation link ⟨ft, kind⟩ when a storage marker rode the reading.
The scan half is already canon (reading_parse/ftid); _fact_type's plan
assembly is the behavioral spec (expectations probed from it verbatim);
_h_fact stays the boundary (instance branch, subtype lift, the strip)."""
