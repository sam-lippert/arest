# (the doctrine correction, 2026-07-08: meaning in canon, boundary for
# TRANSDUCTION only). Byte-level entity substitution, the lex family:
# & < > " to their entities; ints stringify; sequences bottom.
# (_escape_html_impl moved to kernel.py — the base belongs to the kernel;
# the spine must not shadow it.)


# (escape_html is registered by kernel.register_base() — it is a base prim, not
# a spine op. See the note at the foot of this file.)


# The prefix-strip base op — generic string algebra beside implode and
# slug (spec D5): ⟨prefix, s⟩ answers s with a leading prefix removed,
# or s unchanged. No policy — the CHOICE of what to strip is canon's
# (system:sqlcol_base strips the noun off a unary fact type's name).
# (_strip_prefix_impl moved to kernel.py — see the note at the foot of this
# file. The base belongs to the kernel; the spine must not shadow it.)


# (render:json is CANON now — DEF("render:json") beside system:show in the
# repo-root canon, with render:json_atom / render:json_seq. This host's
# emitter was a `json.dumps` transducer, and the same function existed four
# more times: engine/java Reducer.jsonValue, engine/csharp Reducer, and
# engine/rust's v_json (twice, Scott and native). A fold from a value to a
# string has no boundary in it, so it was never a boundary op — and it was
# declared nowhere in the metamodel, unlike the 44 `Definition Origin
# 'registered'` render functions, which emit WIDGETS. Verified equal on both
# lineages before this deletion: the stations went 17 -> 16 refused and now
# print '["menu",[["button","finish","completed"]]]', the same bytes
# engine/rust prints, with the 53 laws and the report md5 unmoved.)


# strip_prefix is registered by kernel.register_base(), NOT here. It is a base
# primitive (metamodel/resolution.md declares it 'registered' beside lex /
# implode / slug / escape_html), and a base primitive that lives in the spine
# is invisible to the thin host, which is how thin.py answered BOTTOM for it
# while all seven other hosts answered a value. Registering it in both places
# would leave one host holding two definitions of one prim, decided by import
# order — so this file no longer defines or registers it.


# The reference RENDER function (AREST.tex §Platform binding, verbatim:
# "Binding a user interface is then registering a render function, so a
# fact renders itself"). MEANING IN CANON: system:render_html is the
# definition of record (tree structure + implode joins over escape_html);
# this host function is the certified-equal PERFORMANCE OVERRIDE, held
# equal by the twin test — the _classify_heads discipline. Toolkit
# renderers (slint, gtk, web-components…) register beside it the same
