"""The Python binding of the INTERSECTION SOURCE vocabulary (shared/*.py),
the repo's layout, and Codd's theta1 bindings (merged from paths.py and
theta.canon, 2026-07-04, the fewer-files push: one module owns how shared
sources are FOUND, LOADED, and NAMED from Python).

An intersection file is normal Python and normal Rust verbatim: statements of nested
calls over the vocabulary DEF, A, N, PHI, S2..S9, semicolon-terminated, double-quoted
strings only, no imports, no assignments, no host functions. Each platform defines
the vocabulary and consumes the same bytes; here Python's exec binds it (the lambda
used determines the implementation), the Rust host include!s the identical file into
a function whose scope defines the same names, and the C# and Java hosts wrap the same
bytes in a varargs method. Definitions land in DEFS as compiled objects and reference
each other by name through rho, so per-host OPTIMIZATIONS (delta, FAST, native) remain
DEFS registrations over the same names."""
