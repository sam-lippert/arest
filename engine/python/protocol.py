"""Migration from an old-engine app .db (the swap tool). The old store rides the
`cells` table as displayed Objects; two encodings appear in live dbs — the keyed
map '{k=<<Role, value>, ...>>, ...}' and the keyless tuple sequence
'<<<Role, value>, ...>>, <<...>>, ...>' (m:n cells) — with the escape alphabet of
the old ast.rs escape_atom_for_display: a backslash escapes each of \\ < > , { }
= inside atom text. Values may quote structural characters (prose descriptions
carry markup), so parsing MASKS every escaped character into the private-use
plane, scans structure, and proves itself by exact round trip; a cell that fails
the proof is reported, never guessed at.

Populations classify against the NEW model: asserted fact types migrate as BATCH
log entries (one derive pass — the old engine's own atomic collection apply is
the precedent; per-row validated creates would cost hours on the big apps),
derived fact types are never replayed — the engine rederives them and the report
VERIFIES old versus new row sets, which is the migration's parity evidence.
