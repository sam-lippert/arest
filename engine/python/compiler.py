M is authored as FORML readings (M_READINGS) and ingested through compile_model like any
schema; Cor. closure means there is no special path for schema-about-schemas. Ingesting M
yields meta-cells that DESCRIBE M — the fixpoint: the instanceOf cell contains
("Object Type", "ObjectType"). M_MAP is M's own relational mapping, from each declared M
fact type to the runtime cell that stores its population; self_gate then runs the book's
test — "to test a full ORM metaschema, you should be able to populate it with itself" —
by validating every mapped cell with the constraints M declares for it.

The recomputation frontier (Cor. streaming) is read off the constraint, ruleReads, and
ruleDerives cells that ingestion wrote; nothing is tracked host-side.

Grammar based on real NORMA verbalization (VerbalizationCoreSnippets.xml + the constraint

open/closed ranges. Parsing is two-pass over a document; compile_model folds it into M.

NO NON-CANONICAL FORML: the grammar accepts NORMA's canonical verbalizations (and the
whitepaper/corpus surfaces for constructs NORMA lacks) — never engine-invented dialects.
